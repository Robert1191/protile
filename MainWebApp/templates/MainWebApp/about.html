         <div class="staffInformation">

           <p>I have extensive tiling experience for over 15 years.
            Iâ€™ve been tiling residential homes and fulfilling corporate level tiling jobs throughout Canada and New Zealand.
            You can be confident that your tiling project will not only look great but would also last for many years to come.
            I am up to date with the latest trends and industry standards that will help you expand your creativity.
            I take pride in laying these tiles and consider them more than just a means of decoration, but also an art work and a form of expression.</p>

          <p>I am reliable, hardworking and approachable. I pay attention to the smallest details.
                I know how just one misaligned tile can ruin the whole project and fixing these can be really expensive.
                Never settle for non-professional installers because you may just end up doubling the cost of the project.
                Cutting corners will only do more harm than good.</p>
